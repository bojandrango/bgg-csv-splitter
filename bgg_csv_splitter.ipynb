    "# BoardGameGeek CSV file splitter\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously I have made a BoardGameGeek fetcher script, that will pull all of the BGG items data from their API and store it as a single CSV file. However I realized that, later on, it would may be problematic to work with a single file, especially for the reason that `categories`, `mechanics`, `designers`, `artists` and `publishers` columns contain multiple values for each column that are comma separated, instead being in their own entry. Therefore this script will use the existing CSV file that I have collected with the previous script, and based on this, it will split the data into multiple CSV files that can be later imported as a separate tables in a database. For instance, `items.csv` will contain the main data for every item that was fetched, where `categories.csv`, `mechanics.csv`, `desginers.csv`, `artists.csv` and `publishers.csv` will contain the additional data for its respective type which is in turn related to a particular item from `items.csv`. With this, I beilieve it will be much easier to join, manipulate and process this data later in the process.\n",
